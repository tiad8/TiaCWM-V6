Android eclair rootfs scripts
--------------------------------------

These scripts are meant to be used by packagers who are creating a new rootfs
image from a local checkout of the git repo.

gitclean.sh
===========
This script will clean out all git-related files from the rootfs. This is not
inherently necessary, but is needed to keep the rootfs small. Run this file
from the root directory of the image.

 * Invocation: $ scripts/gitclean.sh

distprepare.py (REMOVED) - This is no longer needed and is removed from the
repository.

generate-rootfs.sh
==================
This is a quick-and-dirty shell script to generate a rootfs.img from a given
git repository and, optionally, a given branch. This will do everything from
check out the repository to build the filesystem image.

This script uses the following packager script also located in the scripts
directory: gitclean.sh

This script relies upon the following third party utility: genext2fs

There are a few shell variables used in the script as configuration. They are
located at the beginning of the script before any commands. Adjust them as you
see fit, then invoke the script.

This script is not designed to be run in any particular directory. You may run
it even in a live development repository (though this is not suggested). It
will do all work on a temporary git clone, which it then deletes.

If you already have a local clone of the git repository, you can set the REPO
variable to the directory where the repository is located. This will save you
some bandwidth by cloning the local repository and not using the network.

 * Invocation: $ ./generate-rootfs.sh
